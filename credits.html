        <h6 class="m-5 h6"> Albeit our utmost effort in creating all elements of the game, we had used several online resources and would like to give credits to them. Below are some of the sources of the image: </br>Empty Drawer - https://www.cleanpng.com/png-icon-cartoon-drawers-open-drawers-desk-drawers-emp-7925354/ </br>Clinic background - https://www.gardiner.com/projects/queen-marys-hospital-redevelopment </br>In-game characters (except ending) are generated with Playground-v2 AI operated by poe. </br>Without such resources, this game wouldn't be as good as it is now. </h6>
