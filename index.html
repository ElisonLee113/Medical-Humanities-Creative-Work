        <p class="lead m-5">Being a doctor is not only about possessing medical knowledge, but also the spirit of humanity and codes of ethics. These become more important when we are facing the topic of ‘living and dying’. Is surviving good for the patient? Does death make the patient suffer less? It’s time for you to be at a crossroads. 

        </br></br>

            This is a short story which enables us to <b>choose your own path.</b> You, as the doctor, is facing a patient, who suffers from cancer and desire to suicide to avoid further suffering. As the plot proceeds, we will be given two options and have to make our own decisions. The option we make will be the determinants of us and the patient’s ending.  
            
        </br></br>    
            
            Inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, we intend to provide players with an immersive and interactive experience of what a doctor is expected to encounter.  We believe this game will have many resonances for you when you do try to figure out the best response. Hence, we believe this can nurture the humanities and ethics of medical students in an interesting and interactive way. 
            
        </br>  </br>
            
            When thinking of ‘living and dying’, we always believe a successful medical treatment is to save the patient’s life and to lengthen their lifespan. We explore different topics related to ‘living and dying’, for example, power of autonomy, informed consent and physician-assisted suicide, by integrating them into the options. Regarding your choice, you will get different endings. We may have prolonged the patient’s lives, but is it beneficial to the patient?  Through this game, we hope to provide not only medical students, but also the general public, an opportunity to take a glance at the dilemma doctors will face and raise their understanding.  </p>
