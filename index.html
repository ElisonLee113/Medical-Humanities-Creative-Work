        <h1 class="cover-heading"></br>3D story: Doctors, Decisions and Death</h1>
        <p class="lead m-5">Being a doctor is not only about possessing medical knowledge, but also the spirit of humanity and codes of ethics. These become more important when we are facing the topic of ‘living and dying’. Is surviving good for the patient? Does death make the patient suffer less? How does a doctor’s action change a patient’s fate unknowingly? How will the family think of the doctor in case of death? It’s time for you to be at a crossroads. 
          </br></br>This short game will enable you to choose your own path as the doctor facing a cancer patient. As the plot proceeds, you will decide on how to interact with the patient, determining your and your patient’s end, with a bit of luck playing its role.
          </br></br>We intend to provide players with an immersive and interactive experience of what a doctor is expected to encounter, through the median of a web-game-based visual novel.  We believe this story will resonate with your study in medical ethics and humanities as you try to find the best response. We believe this can nurture the humane side of medical students in an interesting and interactive way. 
          </br></br>When thinking of ‘living and dying’, we always believe a successful medical treatment is to save the patient’s life and to lengthen their lifespan. We explore different dilemmas related to power of autonomy, informed consent, and physician-assisted suicide, by integrating them into the options. Through this game, we hope to offer not only medical students, but also the public, an opportunity to understand the ethical problems doctors are facing.
